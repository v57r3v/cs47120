1. Short Answer Question
a.      Explain the six important economic features associated with digital   platforms and   explain how they shape the market competition   landscape   in the   digital   spaces.
b.      Explain the current state of antitrust regulation concerning digital   platforms, with   a focus on   recent developments in the   EU, UK,   US   and   China.
c.      (Preparation for the   Final   Project)   Identify one recent antitrust case that involves      platforms’ self-preferencing   behavior. Apply the economic analysis we learned in   class to investigate the antitrust matter and explain   your thoughts.   Hint:   Lecture Notes on   Blackboard provide few candidate cases. You may   use   academic literature, news article and court documents to support   your argument.
d.      (Preparation for the   Final   Project)   Identify one recent antitrust case that involves   platforms’ envelopment strategy. Apply the economic analysis we learned in   class to investigate the antitrust matter and explain   your thoughts.   Hint:   Lecture   Notes on   Blackboard provide few candidate cases. You may   use   academic   literature, news article and court documents to support   your argument.
2.   Platform. Self Preferencing Strategy
The   market consists of two upstream firms A and   B, and one downstream firm   R.   Both   firms produce   products A and   B at the marginal cost   of 20   (i.e.,   MCA=20,   MCB=20)   and   sell products at a wholesale price of 30   (i.e., WPA=30, WPB=30) to   downstream   firm   R.   The downstream firm   R purchases both products from   upstream firms   at wholesale   prices and sells them to end consumers at   prices of   PA   and   PB    respectively. The   market   demand for both products A and   B are given   by QA=90-2PA+PB   and   QB=90+PA-2PB
a.    When   Firm A and   B are   both   independent from   Firm   R, solve   Firm   R’s   profit   maximization decision to get the market equilibrium.   In particular,   calculate   PA,   PB, QA,   QB,   πA, πB and πR   .


b.    When   Firm A and   B are   independent, does   Firm   R   have any   incentive   to decrease   PA   (i.e., elimination of double marginalization incentive) or   increase   PB            (i.e., raising rival’s cost incentive).   Show   how   both   incentives change   after   Firm A   and   R become vertically   integrated.
c.      When   Firm A and   R are vertically integrated, solve   Firm   R’s profit   maximization   decision to get the   new   market equilibrium.   In   particular, calculate   P’A, P’B, Q’A,   Q’B, π’B    and π’R.
d.      Compare the   market equilibrium from a) and c) above.   In particular,   compare   PB,   QA, QB,    πB   and πR when   Firm A and   R are   independent versus when   Firm A   and      R are vertically integrated. Based on your compari代 写Econ 571 Homework 1 Spring 2025Python

3.   Platform   Envelopment Strategy
Platform. A and T are monopolists in two different   markets.   Consumers’   utilities   of consuming platform. A and platform. T are   uniformity distributed   between zero   and   VA   and VT respectively.
a.      Before the platform. envelopment strategy, each platform. chooses the   optimal price of platform. A and platform. T at VA/2   and VT/2   respectively.   Use   graph   to show   how consumers make their purchase decisions among   1)   consuming A   only, 2) consuming both A and T,   3) consuming T   only, 4)   consuming   non-A   and   non-T.
b.      Now   platform. A (i.e., the attacker) want to enter platform. T’s   market   by   inventing      a similar platform. T’ and bundle A and T’   together.   The   attacker   offers   the   bundle   AT’ to consumers at the sum of two optimal monopolists’   prices,   i.e.   (VT′   +VA   )/2.   Use graph to show how such platform   envelopment   strategy   can   diminish   the   incumbent platform. T’s market share in   the   attacking   market.
c.      Assuming the attacker now offers the AT’ bundle with   a   discount,   i.e.   (VT′   +VA   )/2 –   d.   Use graph to show   how offering a discounted bundle   price   can   diminish   the   incumbent platform. T’s market share even   more in   the   attacking   market.
4.   Horizontal   Merger -   Duopoly   Model
The market consists of two firms   before the merger.   Each   firm’s   marginal   cost   of production   is mc1 =   10 and mc2 =   10. The   market demand   is   P   =   80   −   5Q. Two   of the   firm decides to merge together. After   merger, the market   has   only   one   merged firm, with   the   marginal   cost   of   production   unchanged   atmcm      =   10.


a.      Characterize the market equilibrium before the merger.   In   particular,   characterize   the equilibrium price and quantity, each firm’s supply   and   profit.
b.      Characterize the market equilibrium after the merger.   In   particular, characterize   the equilibrium price, quantity, and profit   of the   merged firm.
c.      Compare the   pre- and post-merger market outcomes. Explain   how   such   merger   can   impact the   market outcomes and whether it is considered as   a   pro-   or   anti-      competitive merger.
After merger, the merged firm generates cost efficiency gains.   Its   marginal   cost   of   production   decreases   tomcm      =   5.
d. Recharacterize the market equilibrium after the   merger.   In   particular, characterize   the equilibrium price, quantity, and profit   of the   merged firm.
e. Compare the pre- and post-merger   market outcomes.   Explain   how   such   cost   efficiency gains can impact the market outcomes and   whether   it   is   considered   as   a   pro- or anti-competitive merger.
